title: "AZR-inspired Energy Forecasting & Anomaly Detection"
abstract: "A production-grade machine learning system that adapts the propose→solve→verify self-play paradigm from Alpha Zero Research to time series forecasting and anomaly detection in energy consumption data. Features household-level prediction with distribution network validation using UK-DALE, London Smart Meters, and SSEN LV feeder data."
